    description: `My name is Christian Nwamba, also called Codebeast. Iâ€™m a Software Engineer and love making things that might possibly work using JavaScript. I currently work as a Senior Cloud Developer AdvocateðŸ¥‘ at Microsoft. I was also a Developer Advocate for 2 years at Cloudinary before joining Microsoft.
    Before becoming an advocate, I loved working as a consultant. I consulted as a Software Developer, Developer Advocate, Technical Writer and Community Champion for startups including Scotch.io, Auth0, Pusher, Cloudinary, Progress, deepstreamHub, Logrocket, Dialog Engineers, Manifold, etc.
    I love working with the developer communities to build an ecosystem. With forces from colleagues and friends we built communities like forLoop Africa, Angular Nigeria, Concatenate Conference, Me.io, Frontstack.io and a lot more. I am responsible for expanding the forLoop Africa communities across new African countries and ecosystems while trying my best to sustain the existing ones.`,

    description: `Tatiana Mac is an independent American designer who works directly with organisations to build clear and coherent products and design systems.
    She believes the trifecta of accessibility, performance, and inclusion can work symbiotically to improve our social landscape digitally and physically. When ethically-minded, she thinks technologists can dismantle exclusionary systems in favour of community-focused, inclusive ones.
    Never totally pleased with design tools, she designs in browser to bring performant, semantic, and accessible visual narratives into the web. Her current obsessions are optimising variable fonts, converting raster images into to SVGs, and recreating modernist paintings in CSS grid. When she can successfully escape vim, she finds new countries to explore (33 and counting).`,
