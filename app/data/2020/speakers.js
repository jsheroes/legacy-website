These vulnerabilities aren't coming from the module ecosystem, as you may expect – they're coming from your own engineering practices. Node.js versions are the root cause of vulnerabilities in production that your team isn't managing effectively. But, there's a light at the end of the tunnel – that light is automation. The Node.js project actively ships updates often and with notice, and does their best to effectively communicate the changes that specifically revolve around security releases. Nevertheless, your Node.js versions are a few releases behind because your app _works_ regardless of the Node.js version that's running – as such, upgrading is a lower priority than literally anything else you could possibly be doing. In this talk you'll learn about the resources that are currently available to help you and your ops team keep your Node.js versions up to date, covering your apps from being attacked with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.`,

Today, static sites are much more dynamic and are a healthy mix of JavaScript, APIs and Markup, aka JAM. They are capable of more complex behavior like processing payments and making authentication requests that are traditionally associated with backend server logic. In this talk, let’s dive into the wonderful world of the JAMstack and how we can harness it to make faster, more secure websites and applications.',

We strive to write performant code for our users, but users don’t directly interact with our code - it all happens through the medium of the browser. The browser is the middleman between us and our users; therefore to make our users happy, we first have to make the browser happy. But how exactly do we do that?</p>

At each step along the way, we’ll cover what we can do as developers to make the browser’s job easier, and why those best practices work. You’ll leave with a solid understanding of how to write code that works *with* the browser, not against it, and ultimately improves your users’ experience.</p>

      <p>Just like us, JavaScript is flawed. But most would agree that the Date-Time handling system in JavaScript is more flawed than anything else. In fact, it is so hard to use that not only do we have a flourishing ecosystem of 3rd party modules focussing on that area, just Moment and Luxon combined have over 50k stars on GitHub and Moment alone has close to 1m weekly downloads on npm. 1 MILLION.</p>
      <p>It is time to add proper Date-Time support to JavaScript. I will be telling you about Temporal, a work-in-progress TC39 proposal that adds state-of-the-art builtins to JavaScript for handling Dates, Times, Calendars and more.</p>
      <p>By the end of the talk, you will know about the various problems in the space, how Temporal seeks to enable developers to solve them gracefully and get a fairly good idea about how to use the Temporal API in your JavaScript code, starting today.</p>`,

      <p>Accessibility (a11y) has been finding its stride in the web development community — and it’s not hard to figure out why. According to the World Health Organization, there are over one billion people globally who need an assistive device. With these statistics, organizations and open source projects alike realize that they could be unintentionally locking these people out of their products. As a result, they adjust their developer workflows. And it often ends there, at the product. Documentation is left out of the conversation.</p>
      <p>If documentation is meant to serve as a tool for learning and comprehension, then it must be included in those conversations. After all, we want to write docs that are truly for everyone — regardless of the technology they use to read it.</p>
      <p>In this talk, we’ll look at how assistive technology consumes documentation and cover some points to consider when building out your docs. Along the way, we’ll touch on quick regulation wins and inclusive writing practices.</p>`,

      <p>We'll take an hands-on approach to identify performance problems, measure them using the React Profiler and we'll fix them using various optimization techniques such as React.memo(), useMemo(), useCallback() and useRef().</p>
      <p>At the end of this workshop you should be able to identify and fix performance problems in React, but also gain a better understanding of React rendering pipeline.</p>

      description: `
      <p>Reactive programming is one of the hottest topics in web development right now and a great part of the JavaScript community is moving from imperative to functional programming paradigms. Yet many developers still struggle to wrap their heads around working with Observables, the cornerstone of reactive programming, mostly due to the complex API, multitude of new concepts and the fundamental shift in coding mindset (from imperative to declarative).</p>
      <p>This workshop will serve as an introduction to thinking reactively and we'll use HTML and JavaScript together with RxJS library to build a simple video game. Although they are a lot fun, writing games can be one of the most complex tasks in software with a multitude of elements to keep track off and coordinate (e.g. scores, timers, or player coordinates). We'll introduce Observables and make heavy use of the operators available in RxJS to create and run the game event-loop, handle inputs and learn how we can manage state only within the stream without relaying on any external state.</p>
      <p>The main focus of the workshop will be to introduce and explore the RxJS Observable API and learn how to effectively create, transform combine and filter them. And although at first it will sounds scary and complicated, in the end it's just a matter of practice and patience before we get the hang of it and ask ourselves: "How did we managed without?".</p>
