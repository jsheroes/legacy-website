      title: 'Humanizing Your Documentation',
      description: `
      <p>It’s no secret that most people don’t read technical documentation for pleasure. Users often come to your docs when they are frustrated with your software, disappointed that they haven't been able to solve the problem on their own and generally feeling pretty low. This is sad, sure, but being aware of these feelings is key for developers and technical writers alike. These emotions frame the reader’s perspective and therefore, should shape the mood of our docs.</p>
      <p>In this talk, we’ll discuss how the language we use affects our users and the first steps towards writing accessible, approachable and use case-driven documentation.</p>`,

      description: `<p>One of the advantages of GraphQL is that it provides great ergonomics for working with realtime data via subscriptions: long-lived, query-like operations that allow us to continuously receive data updates from the server, without worrying too much about the underlying data transfer details. But what <i>do</i> we need to worry about when developing realtime apps with GraphQL, especially if we’re trying to do so at scale? And if we run into performance problems (spoiler: we will!), what can we do about it?</p>
      <p>In this talk, we’ll dig into how GraphQL subscriptions work, and some of the resulting challenges that crop up for developers when dealing with huge amounts of data. We’ll explore approaches to addressing those challenges as implemented in Hasura’s open-source GraphQL engine, with the goal of a better developer experience for building scalable realtime apps.</p>`,

      <p>In this talk we’re going to look at what monorepos are, what problems they solve, pitfalls to watch out for, and then see how different tools can step in and make working in monorepos a delight. We’ll eventually focus in on the open source project Nx, which allows you to automate how your architecture is allowed to grow in a monorepo, and, with its deep knowledge of your project graph, it can optimise CI times, keeping them constant, sometimes making them faster, and in some cases, almost instant.</p>`,
