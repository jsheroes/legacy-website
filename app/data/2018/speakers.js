We’ll build an app designed to cover all of the essential areas for building real applications with GraphQL, dealing with real-world issues that we’ve encountered working with large and complex apps for OK GROW!’s clients. At each step you’ll be taught the concept, given the next goal and the basic outline of the solution, and you’ll work to build the next feature into your own version of the app with one-on-one guidance from the instructors.</p>
        <p>Then we’ll regroup and explore the instructors’ solution (which you have access to on GitHub). At the end you’ll have your own working version of the app plus the instructors’ version.</p>

        'Recursion and iteration are two alternative paradigms for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller chunks; this talk is a deep dive into how these paradigms work, and how JS supports them both. There’s a fundamental tradeoff between the two: the stateful repetition of iteration is often more performant as it’s closer to the way our machines “think”, whereas many programmers find the self-referential abstraction of recursion easier to read & write. In JS prior to ES6, neither paradigm was especially easy to work with: iterative loops were laborious to read and write (not human-efficient), and recursion was limited by the fact that subsequent recursive calls to a function require additional frames added to the stack, potentially leading to stack overflow (not machine-efficient). Eventually, however, all three - recursion, iteration, and JS - were finally brought closer together. In this talk we’ll dive into the nature of the two paradigms, examine what an Iterable and a tail-recursive function are, and learn how Tail Call Optimization unites the two paradigms, allowing us to write code recursively and run it iteratively.',

        <p>For the first part we are going to talk about the building blocks of the platform (touchables, text input, lists, animation, etc), layout/styling, navigation, debugging, native libraries and testing. For the second part, we are going to build an app together with all the concepts we previously learnt.</p>

      <p>Node.js applications can be run at the command line, but we'll focus on running them as a service, so that they will automatically restart on reboot or failure, and can safely be used in a production environment. We will cover setting up a secure production-ready Node.js environment with failover on multi Ubuntu 16.04 server.</p><p>The servers will run a Node.js application that will provide users with secure access to the application through a Nginx reverse proxy. The Nginx server will offer HTTPS, using a free certificate provided by Let's Encrypt.</p>
